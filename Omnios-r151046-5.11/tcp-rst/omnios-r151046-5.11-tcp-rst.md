# Description
Omnios r151046, kernel SunOS Omnios 5.11 has a denial of service vulnerability. For the processing of TCP RST packets, Omnios has a wide acceptable range of sequence numbers. It does not require the sequence number to exactly match the next expected sequence value, just to be within the current receive window, which violates RFC5961. This flaw allows attackers to send multiple random TCP RST packets to hit the acceptable range of sequence numbers, thereby interrupting normal connections and causing a denial of service attack.

# Reproduction
## Environment
Test machine - Virtual Machine 1: The system is not limited, such as Ubuntu system. Python, scapy, pcapy, impacket environments are installed. IP1: 192.168.56.104 
Target system - Virtual Machine 2: OmniOS operating system. GCC runtime environment is installed. IP2: 192.168.56.112 
The two virtual machines can communicate over the network.
