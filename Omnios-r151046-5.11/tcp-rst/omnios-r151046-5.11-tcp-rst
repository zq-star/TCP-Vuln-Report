# Description
Omnios r151046, kernel SunOS Omnios 5.11 has a denial of service vulnerability. For the processing of TCP RST packets, Omnios has a wide acceptable range of sequence numbers. It does not require the sequence number to exactly match the next
expected sequence value, just to be within the current receive window. This flaw allows attackers to send multiple random TCP RST packets to hit the acceptable range of sequence numbers, thereby interrupting normal connections and causing a denial of service attack.
