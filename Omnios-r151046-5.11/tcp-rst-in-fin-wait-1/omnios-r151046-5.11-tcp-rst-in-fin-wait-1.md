# Description
Omnios r151046, kernel SunOS Omnios 5.11 has a denial of service vulnerability. For the processing of TCP RST packets in FIN-WAIT-1 STATE, Omnios has a wide acceptable range of sequence numbers. It does not require the sequence number to exactly match the next expected sequence value, just to be within the current receive window. This flaw allows attackers to send multiple random TCP RST packets to hit the acceptable range of sequence numbers, thereby interrupting the ongoing connection termination process and causing a denial of service attack.

# Reproduction
## Environment
* Test machine - virtual machine 1: The system is not limited, such as Ubuntu system. Python, scapy, pcapy, impacket environments are installed. IP1: 192.168.56.111 
* Target system - virtual machine 2: OmniOS operating system. GCC runtime environment is installed. IP2: 192.168.56.109
* The two virtual machines can communicate over the network.

## Experiment Overview
Virtual machine 1 sends a packet or system call to virtual machine 2 of the omnios system. The sending sequence is LISTEN, SYN(V,0), ACK(V,V), ACCEPT, CLOSECONNECTION, RST(INV, 0). The response of virtual machine 2 after receiving RST(INV, 0) packet is mainly observed. If the connection is interrupted after receiving RST(INV, 0) packet, there is a vulnerability. 
* Note1: LISTEN means notifying virtual machine 2 to system call listen as a server. ACCEPT and CLOSECONNECTION are also system call commands with different functions. The remaining SYN(V,0), ACK(V,V) and RST(INV, 0) represent TCP packets of different flags. The first bit in the bracket represents the sequence number, and the second bit represents the acknowledgment number. Each bit is divided into two categories: V and INV. ​​In general​​, V means valid - this value is equal to the expected exact value of normal communication, and INV means invalid - this value does not exactly match the expected exact value and is within the receiving window range. 0 means - the value is 0.

## Files Preparation
* File [poc.py](https://github.com/zq-star/TCP-Vuln-Report/blob/master/Omnios-r151046-5.11/tcp-rst-in-fin-wait-1/poc.py): Located in test machine - virtual machine 1 environment. Poc is responsible for sending corresponding data packets according to specified order. 
* File [socketAdapter.c](https://github.com/zq-star/TCP-Vuln-Report/blob/master/Omnios-r151046-5.11/SutAdapter/socketAdapter.c)[^socketAdapterCode]: Located in target system - virtual machine 2 environment. System call may be required in the implementation of TCP. The socketAdapter.c file is mainly responsible for identifying received commands and making system calls according to commands. For example: if “listen” is received, virtual machine 2 will initiate a connection as a server. In addition, socketAdapter.c will generate new port value of actual communication process and pass it to the test end-virtual machine 1, which will be used as the communication port of target system end.

## Reproduction steps
1. In target system - virtual machine 2:
   * Run `gcc -Wall -pthread -o socketAdapter.o socketAdapter.c -lnsl -lsocket`. Compile socketAdapter.c and generate the socketAdapter.o executable file. 
   * Run `sudo nice -19 ./socketAdapter.o -a 192.168.56.111 -l 5000 -p 20000`. Make target system in state of listening to commands.
2. In test machine - virtual machine 1:
   * Run `sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags RST RST -j DROP`. This step is to avoid interference caused by automatic packet sending by system kernel of virtual machine 1.
   * Run `sudo python poc.py`. The [poc.py](https://github.com/zq-star/TCP-Vuln-Report/blob/master/Omnios-r151046-5.11/tcp-rst-in-fin-wait-1/poc.py) sends packets of specified types in order: LISTEN, SYN(V,0), ACK(V,V), ACCEPT, CLOSECONNECTION, RST(INV, 0).
3. Capture packets to observe responses of omnios system - virtual machine 2 during running [poc.py](https://github.com/zq-star/TCP-Vuln-Report/blob/master/Omnios-r151046-5.11/tcp-rst-in-fin-wait-1/poc.py):

   * First, a socket connection is automatically established to pass command, and virtual machine 2 transmits actual communication port of local end，which is used for the following communication test of packets in order.
   * Virtual machine 1 sends LISTEN, SYN(V, 0), ACK(V, V) and ACCEPT, virtual machine 2 responds with SYN+ACK. At this time, virtual machine 2 is in ESTABLISHED STATE.
   * Virtual machine 1 sends CLOSECONNECTION, virtual machine 2 responds with FIN+ACK. At this time, virtual machine 2 is in FIN-WAIT-1 STATE.
   * Virtual machine 1 sends a RST packet with a sequence number within the receive window. Virtual machine 2 does not respond. At this time, if Virtual machine 1 sends a new SYN with random sequence number, Virtual machine 2 accepts the new request with SYN+ACK response indicating that it returns to LISTEN STATE and the ongoing connection termination process is interrupted, causing a denial of service attack.
